Entropy:
we calculate this to make the tree node and everything. 
Entropy always say how it is distributed more the distribution more the entropy 

formula: Sumation form 1 to n - (propability()log2 propability()) this is how i could do it 



Ig (information gain) = Ep(entropy of parent) - Wgain * Ec(entropy of child)
